Gaussian splatting has become popular in graphics and rendering.  What if we could use Gaussians to represent a hyperspectral datacube instead of a voxel-based approach.  This has siginificant advantages in terms of 1) memory needed to store the datacube 2) forward simulation time and 3) compression ratio for reconstruction.

I'm exploring this idea and mentoring some students.
